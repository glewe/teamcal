   Non-alphanumeric user names were leading to irregular results on non-english
   servers using differnet char coding. To avoid this, only alphanumeric chars
   are allowed in team member names.

CHANGES
01 HTML and CSS Compatibility
   Based on the much appreciated work of Thomas Suess I revisted the HTML and
   CSS code and implemented compatibility to HTML 4.01 Transitional and CSS 2.1.
   Note that the different browsers still render the pages individually, thus,
   the display experience may change based on the browser you use. I recommend
   Firefox as the most compatible reference broswer.
   
02 Popup Window Size
   With the years, browser versions and screen resolutions got changed a lot.
   Thomas (see above) suggested to adjust the window sizes so that scrolling
   is reduced to a minimum.

03 License
   Added the TeamCal license texts to the Doc folder.
   
04 CSS
   Streamlined the cascading style sheet, e.g. changed all font size values from
   pt to px due to the broader compatibility with browser rendering.

05 Application Subtitle
   The application subtitle can now be set in the config file.
